Question 1: Explain the difference between analog and digital signals.

Analog signals can take on any value within a range, like 0  to 3.3 V, and change smoothly  like a wave, and digital signals are not continuous and have a finite set of values and use HIGH(1) or LOW(1).


Question 2: Give an example of something that uses digital signals and how it uses it.

A keyboard uses digital signals; for example, when you click a key, it sends HIGH(1), and when it is not pressed, it sends LOW(0).


Question 3: Give an example of something that uses analog signals and how it uses it.

A microphone uses analog signals when there is a louder sound there is a higher voltage but when there is a lower sound it is a lower voltage. Because sound is usually continous the voltage changes smoothly over time.
